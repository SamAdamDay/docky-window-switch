Notes on how to do a localization (l10n) for gnome-do
=====================================================

Creating a l10n:
        First of all you create a template to base your translation on:
                intltool-update --pot

        Then copy it to your translation
                cp gnunit.pot ca_ES.po
        Do your translation, with some kind of editor
                emacs ca_ES.po
		it has to be UTF-8 encoded.

        Add your l10n to configure.in, find the ALL_LINGUAS variable and add your
        l10n to it.

Please, pay special when doing the translations because most of the logic puzzles
need to have very clear and precise questions to be fair.

Updating your l10n:
------------------
        To update an existing po fx ca_ES.po:
                intltool-update ca_ES
