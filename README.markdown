Docky with Window Switching
---------------------------

A small fork Docky (2.1.4) which changes the behaviour of clicking on an app. Now, if there is only one window open, it brings that one forward, and does nothing else on subsequent clicks. If there are multiple windows open, it cycles through them.

Yes, I know that this sort of thing can already be achieved by using the mouse wheel on an app; I just wanted it to work by left-click too.
